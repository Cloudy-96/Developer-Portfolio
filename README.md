To celebrate my coding journey being over a year, and the 100+ day marker of working in an awesome industry I have decided to revamp my portfolio with some updated projects and milestones.

I have come so far, and learned so much and am extited to keep learning even more. A dev's journey is never done.

It's not about the destination but the journey.
